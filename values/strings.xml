	<string name="story">First of all, what are the common complaints
		with
		Android smartphone devices? Issues such as: system halted; application
		crashes; slow booting; and, battery life.\n

		A year ago, I purchased my
		first Android phone and installed CM ROM. Within months, I became very
		annoyed that my battery did not last the entire day. I could go to
		bed, with a full battery
		charge, and awake in the morning to find that
		the battery charge had
		dropped significantly overnight. I found this
		situation to be
		unacceptable! To solve this, I downloaded power-saving
		applications.
		Every day I would install a different power saving
		application, charge
		the battery to full power before bed, and then
		check the battery in
		the morning. After a month of testing power saving
		applications, I
		didn\'t find a satisfactory solution and some of the
		so-called power
		saving apps even made the battery drain faster. So, I
		thought I would
		create an app for myself, that could tweak system
		parameters and help
		save my battery. Nine months ago, I started writing
		a power tweaking
		application for myself. I studied the intracies of the
		Android power
		management mechanism and within a few months I had the
		basis for an
		application that could optimize my power management.
		Everyday, I
		tweaked the power optimization parameters and tested each
		night. One
		morning, I awoke and was thrilled to discover that the
		battery charge
		had only decreased by a small amount. So, I turned my
		personal power
		saving tweaker into a user-friendly power saving
		application that
		anyone could use. I am sharing my application, One
		Power Guard with
		you.\n

		If you would like to try One Power
		Guard,
		Download from
		onexuan.com\n\n
		To save power, One
		power Guard do some
		optimization:\n
		1. Extends stand-by time and battery life; optimizes
		charging parameters\n
		2. Optimizes system kernel and CPU usage to improve device performance\n
		3. Six (6) customized power-saving modes to suit different scenarios\n
		4. Proactively guards from power-killer apps and safely shuts down
		useless power-consuming programs\n
		5. Fast ON/OFF settings for 100% system customization\n
		6. Intelligently switches to/from WiFi/Cell data to preserve battery
		life\n
		7. Professional Tips on power optimization\n\n

		Why do you need One Power
		Guard? and Test One Power Guard for yourself.\n
		1. Fully
		charge
		your
		battery before you go to bed. In the morning, check your
		battery
		status
		and note how much is remaining.
		2. After installing One
		Power
		Guard,
		fully charge the battery before you go to bed.
		In the
		morning,
		check your
		battery status, you will be impressed by the power
		savings!\n
		3. To
		compare the
		optimization results, you need to restart the phone so
		that
		you have a clean

		contacted me about an issue that came up after installing the 2.1
		version of One Power Guard. He said his device lagged in Standby mode.
		I told him that we can work together to solve his problem. After work,
		I went back to my dorm. I started to write a test interface for him
		and 1.5 hours later, we started testing. He began to test my ten-step
		interface - each step ran well. But the issue was not resolved. I
		asked him to select AI mode - his device lagged. What we found is that
		his device did not support changing CPU frequencies. So my judgment
		was that this was an I/O scheduler issue, it was set to "CFQ". I asked
		him to try changing his I/O scheduler. (His Rom Only support CFQ and
		Noop). He changed to "Noop" and the lag went away - issue resolved!
		\n\nFinal conclusion: Tweak the settings until your device performs to
		your satisfaction.
